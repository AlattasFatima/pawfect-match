                Provide a spacious, clean habitat: <br>
                <div class="carddiv">
                    Ensure your bird has a cage that is
                    appropriately sized for its species, with enough room to move around, spread its wings,
                    and engage in natural behaviors. The cage should have perches of varying sizes and textures
                    to maintain foot health, as well as toys for mental stimulation. Clean the cage, perches,
                    and toys regularly to prevent the buildup of bacteria and waste.

            <li>
                Offer a balanced diet and fresh water:<br>
                <div class="carddiv">
                    Feed your bird a species-appropriate diet
                    that includes a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and a high-quality pellet or
                    seed mix. Avoid giving your bird human junk food, as it can be harmful to their health.
                    Provide fresh, clean water daily in a clean bowl or water bottle. Make sure to wash food
                    and water dishes regularly to prevent bacterial growth.

            <br>



            <li>
                Ensure proper veterinary care and socialization:<br>
                <div class="carddiv">
                    Schedule regular check-ups with
                    an avian veterinarian to monitor your bird's health and address any issues early on.
                    Keep your bird up-to-date on any necessary vaccinations or preventive treatments.
                    Spend time socializing with your bird daily, as they are highly intelligent and social creatures.
                    Provide opportunities for supervised time outside the cage to stretch their wings and interact with you or
                    other family members.
